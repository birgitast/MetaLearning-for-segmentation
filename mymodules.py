class MetaConvTranspose2d(nn.ConvTranspose2d, MetaModule):
    """Applies a 2D transposed convolution operator over an input image
    composed of several input planes.

    This module can be seen as the gradient of Conv2d with respect to its input.
    It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or
    a deconvolution (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation).

    This module supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
      sides for ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` number of points. See note
      below for details.

    * :attr:`output_padding` controls the additional size added to one side
      of the output shape. See note below for details.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the à trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{out\_channels}{in\_channels}\right\rfloor`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`output_padding`
    can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimensions
        - a ``tuple`` of two ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the height dimension,
          and the second `int` for the width dimension

    .. note::

         Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
         columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid `cross-correlation`_,
         and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
         It is up to the user to add proper padding.

    Note:
        The :attr:`padding` argument effectively adds ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding``
        amount of zero padding to both sizes of the input. This is set so that
        when a :class:`~torch.nn.Conv2d` and a :class:`~torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d`
        are initialized with same parameters, they are inverses of each other in
        regard to the input and output shapes. However, when ``stride > 1``,
        :class:`~torch.nn.Conv2d` maps multiple input shapes to the same output
        shape. :attr:`output_padding` is provided to resolve this ambiguity by
        effectively increasing the calculated output shape on one side. Note
        that :attr:`output_padding` is only used to find output shape, but does
        not actually add zero-padding to output.

    Note:
        In some circumstances when using the CUDA backend with CuDNN, this operator
        may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is
        undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at
        a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic =
        True``.
        Please see the notes on :doc:`/notes/randomness` for background.

        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` zero-padding
            will be added to both sides of each dimension in the input. Default: 0

            of each dimension in the output shape. Default: 0

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})` where

        .. math::
              H_{out} = (H_{in} - 1) \times \text{stride}[0] - 2 \times \text{padding}[0] + \text{dilation}[0]
                        \times (\text{kernel\_size}[0] - 1) + \text{output\_padding}[0] + 1
        .. math::

                        \times (\text{kernel\_size}[1] - 1) + \text{output\_padding}[1] + 1

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape

                         The values of these weights are sampled from
                         :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where
                         :math:`k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{out} * \prod_{i=0}^{1}\text{kernel\_size}[i]}`
        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape (out_channels)
                         If :attr:`bias` is ``True``, then the values of these weights are
                         sampled from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where
                         :math:`k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{out} * \prod_{i=0}^{1}\text{kernel\_size}[i]}`
